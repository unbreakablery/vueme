        <b>
            1.10. Chargebacks and Reversals.
        </b>
        Model acknowledges and agrees that any Payment by a User is subject to a right of chargeback if paid by credit or debit card or reversal if an ACH transaction, as these rights exist between the User and his/her respective bank or credit card issuer. In the event of a chargeback or reversal of any Payment by a User, VueMe will automatically deduct such amount plus any fees associated with the chargeback or reversal from your bank account. Thereafter, VueMe will open a resolution case and investigate the reason for the charge back. You agree to cooperate with VueMe and to provide any information that may be reasonably requested by VueMe in its investigation. In the event it is determined that the Model was not at fault in connection with the chargeback, VueMe will use commercially reasonable efforts to dispute the chargeback on your behalf. In the event it is determined that the chargeback was due to Model negligence or other similar circumstances, VueMe will, in its sole discretion, charge the Chargeback Fee to the Model. You are liable for all chargeback or reversals of Payments processed on your behalf by VueMe, including the Chargeback Fee listed in the Fees Schedule. You acknowledge that chargeback and reversal decisions are made by the applicable issuing bank or credit card networks and all judgments as to the validity of the chargeback or reversal is made at the sole discretion of the applicable issuing bank or credit card networks and that VueMe shall have no liability or responsibility in connection with any chargeback or reversal.
